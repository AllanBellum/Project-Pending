It’s Freshman Orientation Day! You don’t really want to go, but it might be important. Do you go? 
Don’t go to Freshman Orientation. 
Go to Freshman Orientation.
You decide that there are other things you’d like to do today. You relax for most of the day, take a nice walk, watch a show you like, and generally chill out.
You think that getting to know what the next four years of your life is pretty important. You’d rather be as ready as you can be for them. You find it dull, but you do feel more prepared for the path ahead.

Oh no! You're sick, but you have class today. And it’s the one you’re behind in! Do you risk going to class?
Stay home and recover.
You go to class and tough it out.
You decide that it’s better to try and recover from your illness rather than tough it out. The next day you feel a lot better! You are really able to buckle down and catch up on your classwork! You feel great!
Doing this was a mistake; you can barely pay attention in class. You can also feel your classmates stare as you hack and cough all throughout the lecture. You didn’t learn anything and you are thoroughly embarrassed.

Your friends want to hang out and play some video games with you. But you have a test tomorrow. You feel underprepared, but you have also felt super stressed out lately. Do you hang out with your friends? 
Hang out with your friends
Study for the test
You decide that you need a break. You go and hang out with your bros. You play a varied assortment of games. It was a blast, and was just the break you needed. Come the day of the test you remember a lot more than you expected to, but ultimately do just okay. You're satisfied with the result, but felt you could have done better.
You really buckle down and go into a hardcore study session. The information is filling up your brain giving you a better understanding of the material than before. The day of the test you fly through the questions you know every answer and you ace the test. You’re relieved it’s over, but you feel burnt out.

You think that living on campus is getting expensive, and your parents live close enough to school that you could reasonably commute to class. But you love the experience of dorm life and feel that commuting wouldn’t be as fulfilling. Do you start commuting to class?
Start commuting to class
Continue living on campus
You are able to save a lot more money and are more able to pay your tuition in upcoming semesters. You miss the communal space of campus life, but hey, what are you going to do?
You’re glad you continue living on campus. While your bank account is as empty, but that’s okay. Despite its ups and downs, living on campus is still better than living with your parents.

You feel that with all of the things going on and the clubs you’ve been attending that you need a way to keep up with both your friends and club activities. And all of them are on legally distinct social media platform, do you create an account or do you live unconnected from your peers?
Stay unconnected
Create the account
You wonder what could be if you join, but decide you really don’t want to link another thing to your email account.
You waste so much of your time aimlessly scrolling the depths of the platform forgetting to do schoolwork and you have noticed a significant worsening in your mood recently.

Go bowling!
Stay home
Your friends are fun and you manage to win the game! There were some new friends in the group that you met. Your headspace is clear and you are able to focus on school and work even better.
You decide you better not go. You see the fun your friends had and wish you went. You got nothing done while at home.

You are going to work one day when you hear a POP sound. Your tire has burst asunder and gone flat. On the side of the road you realize you forgot to get a spare. You can either test your luck trying to get to the closest place that’ll change your tire, or call up your dad for help?
Drive to find a spare tire
Call dad
The flat is making it difficult to drive, every turn is harder than usual, speeding up from a stand still is a nightmare, and you have to wrestle with the wheel to keep the car from careening into oncoming traffic, until WHAM! Another car smashes into you. You’re unhurt, but your car is totaled. This is going to cost you a lot of money.
You call up your dad and he’s there in 20 minutes. He has a spare, but insists on teaching you how to change a tire by demonstrating how to do it, then undoing for you to do. You already know how to change a tire. It was a trying experience.

Everything about your job is terrible. Your boss sucks, your coworkers are irritating, and the job is mind numbing beyond all belief. You can’t stay here any longer. The question is whether this place is so unbearable that you quit then find a job, or find a job then quit?
Quit first
Find another job first
That is a load off of your mind, you feel freed from the shackles of the soul sucking misery and can sleep knowing you don’t have to go back tomorrow. Finding another job isn’t easy (especially when you don’t already have one) but you are certain you’ll find one soon enough.
The remaining time you spend at your job is one of the worst experiences of your working life. It feels like your head is in an ever tightening vice grip from dawn to dusk. But you found a job far easier and quicker than you’d expected. Heck it even pays better than this one. You wave your personal hell goodbye and look toward the future.

It’s almost Thanksgiving Break. You kinda want to go to your family’s Thanksgiving, but you also know you’d probably have to deal with that uncle who just has the worst opinions. It never goes well, and it’s such an unappealing prospect you might just stay here and study. 
Go
Don't Go
You were right, everything was fine except for that uncle and getting stuck talking to him. Who the hell thinks that America should invade and conquer the Moon and kill all the “moon demons”. At least your parents let you take a lion’s share of the leftovers feeding you for weeks.
You kinda regret not going, you wanted to catch up with your cousins and parents. Plus the turkey and stuffing is always good. At least you got some great studying in.

You’re in a super hardcare study session, but there’s a serious problem. You’re so hungry you could eat a horse. Unfortunately you have no idea where to get one at this time of day, so you have to settle for something else. You’ve been trying to eat healthier recently, but preparing a meal right now would take a while, and you have the money to get something delivered. What to do?
Get Pizza
Cook yourself a nice healthy meal
Pizza is the perfect study food. Not having to make your own food really allows you to get into the fine details of your material. You even have breakfast for tomorrow! Though your stomach is more upset than usual when you lie down to go to sleep.
Cooking the meal really cuts into your study time, but sticking to your commitment to your physical health feels great. You are only able to get a more general idea of the material, but you understand it a bit better. You go to sleep resolute.

One of your friends invites you to a session of Dungeons and Dragons. You’ve never played it before, but it seems fun. In spite of all of that you got more homework than you’d like to have currently, should you attend the D&D session or get ahead on your homework?
Do homework
Play D&D
Homework sucks. But hey you got your stuff done. Wish you had gone to D&D though.
The D&D session was top tier stuff. Plus the DM bought pizza so you didn’t have to buy food for dinner. Everyone was cool and you had a massive amount of fun. Worth it.

 You just had a major falling out with a friend. You feel like your world has entered a state of flux. Nothing feels right anymore. All of your worst mistakes and failures come flooding back to you. Nothing feels right anymore and you feel like the worst person to walk the earth. What are you going to do?
Talk to someone about
Push it all down and go to the gym
You call up an old friend and just start to unfurl. You start bawling your eyes out, but when all is said and done you feel better. You feel like you can start moving forward instead of holding yourself back. It still hurts obviously, but the wound feels like it can properly heal.
Who knew that physical exercise can’t address serious psychological issues? Not you. If anything you just made things worse for yourself. You even crush your toe with a dumbbell. Ow.

Rumors are spreading around campus that one of the econ professors got abducted by aliens. They are even claiming that he got abducted on the roof of the student center when he stepped out to take a smoke break. Your friends bandy around the idea of camping out on the roof to try and get a glimpse of some aliens, maybe even get abducted.
Pfft, Who believes in aliens?
I’d love to get abducted by aliens
You decide to stay home and study instead. Aliens, at least aliens intelligent enough to create interstellar travel, are so unlikely to actually exist that camping out on the roof of the student center seems like a waste of time. That is until you see your friends the next day visibly shaken. None of them want to talk about what happened. What happened last night?
You and your friends sneak onto the student center’s roof after hours and camp out. You tell scary stories and eat s'mores, going to sleep on the roof at around 11PM. That is until you are awoken by a strange glowing light and you start floating in the air, and that is your last memory of that night. You wake up back on the student center roof holding a manilla envelope containing a wad of 20 dollar bills, the answers to your exam next week, and a thank you note with a bug-eyed green alien sticker on it. What the Funk.

After seeing a tutor and working your butt off, your GPA dramatically improves, but you have lost time with friends and it's taking a toll.
You have given up on school. You feel dropping out was the only option, so you drop out before school can kick you out. This ultimatly gives you more time to work and be with your friends, but you have to question if this was the correct path.

You stick with your major and continue to struggle. Eventually you get kicked out of the school. You lose drive to continue your education.

You feel lethargic, you don’t think you got enough sleep last night. The last thing you want to do is get out of bed. Yet, you still need to get the day started and that is difficult to do in bed. 
Stay in Bed
Push through it and get out of bed
You continue to lie in bed convinced that lying there will give you more energy. But an hour goes by and you still feel tired. The only reason you get out is because you need to pee really bad. Maybe you did get enough sleep, but just woke up weird. Either way you’re slow to get going today. 
You feel like death for a little bit, but once you’re actually moving you feel a lot better. Your morning routine goes smoothly. And after you’ve finished you feel better than usual. Today’s gonna be a good day.

It’s a cold winter’s night and you can’t sleep. You look outside your window, snow covers the ground and the soft lighting outside lends a somber melancholic beauty to the scene you are witness to. You are far too restless to go back to sleep, but the exhaustion of the day still weighs on you. What should you do?
Go for a walk
Lie in bed and look out the window
Despite being so late and cold there are more people out than you’d expect. Still, it’s peaceful. The air is surprisingly still, the snowfall is light and delicate, and the night is just bright enough to be able to easily see, yet feel dark. It’s otherworldly. Once you got home and went to bed you had a great night’s sleep.
The night is calm and the snowflakes fall with delicate precision. The silence is comforting instead of eerie.From the warmth of your bed the chill emanating from the window is almost refreshing. Time almost stands still in this picturesque moment. You wake up the next morning not having remembered when you fell asleep. It was a great night’s sleep.

You’re exploring the campus one day when out of the corner of your eye you see something strange. You think it to be the Dean of Students in a fight with a deer. It takes you what feels like minutes to process the fact that this is actually happening. What snaps you out of your trance is the Dean shouting “Aid me in my fight against the local fauna or suffer the consequences!’
Aid the Dean
Aid the Deer
 That talk of suffering consequences shakes you to your core. Just sounds like a bad time so you join the fight against the Deer and a few punches and kicks later it goes down. The Dean turns to you “Here, take this a tithe for your assistance, there will be more to come as well” he says handing you a thick stack of $100 Bills. You are in disbelief.
 No one can tell you what to do. Good thing you can still remember those capoeira lessons you took last summer. With the assistance of the Deer you make short work of the Dean. As he falls to the ground you hear a faint whisper, almost a hiss “consequences”. You shrug it off hoping that this won’t come back to bite you. You give the Deer a high-five and then steal the Dean’s wallet.
