Oh no! You're sick, but you have class today. And it’s the one you’re behind in! Do you risk going to class?
Stay home and recover.
You go to class and tough it out.
You decide that it’s better to try and recover from your illness rather than tough it out. The next day you feel a lot better! You are really able to buckle down and catch up on your classwork! You feel great!
Doing this was a mistake; you can barely pay attention in class. You can also feel your classmates stare as you hack and cough all throughout the lecture. You didn’t learn anything and you are thoroughly embarrassed.

Hang out with your friends
Study for the test

Come the day of the test you remember a lot more than you expected to, but ultimately do just okay. You're satisfied with the result, but felt you could have done better.
You really buckle down and go into a hardcore study session. The information is filling up your brain giving you a better understanding of the material than before. The day of the test you fly through the questions you know every answer and you ace the test. You’re relieved it’s over, but you feel burnt out.

You think that living on campus is getting expensive, and your parents live close enough to school that you could reasonably commute to class. But you love the experience of dorm life and feel that commuting wouldn’t be as fulfilling. Do you start commuting to class?
Start commuting to class
Continue living on campus
You are able to save a lot more money and are more able to pay your tuition in upcoming semesters. You miss the communal space of campus life, but hey, what are you going to do?
You’re glad you continue living on campus. While your bank account is as empty, but that’s okay. Despite its ups and downs, living on campus is still better than living with your parents.

You feel that with all of the things going on and the clubs you’ve been attending that you need a way to keep up with both your friends and club activities. And all of them are on legally distinct social media platform, do you create an account or do you live unconnected from your peers?
Stay unconnected
Create the account
You wonder what could be if you join, but decide you really don’t want to link another thing to your email account.
You waste so much of your time aimlessly scrolling the depths of the platform forgetting to do schoolwork and you have noticed a significant worsening in your mood recently.
